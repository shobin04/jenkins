<br>

- Create a new Slack channel (use your own workspace) and sent the notification post the above build to the channel

    ```
<br>

- Integrate the Sonar scanning into the above pipeline

- Configure the Webhook to ensure it is continuous integration via the pipeline
<br>

- Send the success/failure notification your cloudifyops email id and slack channel you created previously
<br>

- Add a Linux Node  to the Jenkins and assign to the above job to the slave machine
<br>

- Checkout the maximum number of jobs that we can run concurrently on Jenkins. Set the maximum value to "3‚Äù
<br>

- How to reset the build number in Jenkins for the above job?
<br>

- Schedule the above job to run nightly daily at 9 pm
<br>
